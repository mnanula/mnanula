#  Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
#  - Models next step as a linear function of the differenced observations and residual errors at prior time steps
#  - combines Autoregression and Moving Average models and differences pre-processing step of the sequence to make the sequence stationary
#  - extra step is called integration to achieve stationarity
