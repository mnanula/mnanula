#  Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors
#  - Extension of the SARIMA model that includes exogenous variables
#  - Exogenous variables are also called covariates... Parallel inputs with observations at the same time steps as the original series
#  - Primary series is called endogenous

# SARIMAX example
from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX
from random import random
# contrived dataset
data1 = [x + random() for x in range(1, 100)]
data2 = [x + random() for x in range(101, 200)]
# fit model
model = SARIMAX(data1, exog=data2, order=(1, 1, 1), seasonal_order=(0, 0, 0, 0))
model_fit = model.fit(disp=False)
# make prediction
exog2 = [200 + random()]
yhat = model_fit.predict(len(data1), len(data1), exog=[exog2])
print(yhat)
