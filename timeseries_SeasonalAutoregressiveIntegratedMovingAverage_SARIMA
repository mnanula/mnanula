#  Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
#  - Models the next step in the sequence as a linear function of the differenced observations, errors, 
#    differenced seasonal observations, and seasonal errors at prior time steps
#  - Combines ARIMA with ability to perform autoregression, differencing, moving average modeling at the seasonal level
#  - Can be used for univatiate time series data with trend and/or seasonal components

# SARIMA example
from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX
from random import random
# contrived dataset
data = [x + random() for x in range(1, 100)]
# fit model
model = SARIMAX(data, order=(1, 1, 1), seasonal_order=(0, 0, 0, 0))
model_fit = model.fit(disp=False)
# make prediction
yhat = model_fit.predict(len(data), len(data))
print(yhat)
